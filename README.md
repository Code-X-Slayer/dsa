# 📚 Data Structures & Algorithms Practice (Java)

This repository is a **personal DSA practice and showcase** built while following **Kunal Kushwaha’s DSA YouTube playlist and assignments**.
Huge thanks to **Kunal Kushwaha** for the free, structured, and beginner-friendly guidance that makes consistent learning possible 🙌

The goal of this repo is **learning, not competitive coding platforms** — focusing on **core logic, problem-solving, and clean Java implementations**.

---

## 🚀 How This Repository Is Structured

* Each **topic has its own folder**
* Inside every topic folder:

  * Java files with **core logic**
  * Clear and readable implementations
  * No direct platform-specific boilerplate (LeetCode / GFG / etc.)
* Problems are solved step-by-step as part of **daily practice and consistency**

This repo will **grow gradually** as I continue learning and practicing.
